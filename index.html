            <h2>What is Python?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Python is an extremely simple and versatile programming language, because its syntax is modern and
            straightforward, and it is designed to allow developers to write instructions with fewer lines of code.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this case, because it is easy to understand, it was a language that gained popularity among companies due
            to its lean code. In addition, it has a large amount of libraries available to assist in our daily lives,
            and it has a large community of developers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Got it, cool! I want to know more about this language, from its origin to the present day. Is this possible?
            Sure, come on!
        </p>
    </section>

    <section  id="How_did_the_Python_language_come_about?" class="main-section">
        <header>
            <h2>How did the Python language come about?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The development of the Python language started in the late 1980s by Guido Van Rossum, while he was working at
            Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica - CWI - in Amsterdam. His goal was to create a more efficient scripting
            language capable of accessing the resources of the Amoeba operating system.</p>
        <p>In 1994, the first version of the Python language appeared. The name chosen has no relation to the snake
            species of the same name, although its logo is that of two intertwined snakes. Instead, the choice was in
            function of a television show of the time created by a group of comedians called Monty Python.</p>
        <p>Since then, the Python language has received several updates. It is open-source and available under the PSF
            License Agreement, which is similar to the General Public License (GPL). It is currently at version 3.9.5
            and you can download Python for free from the language's official homepage.</p>
    </section>

        <header>
            <h2>What is Python for? Some specifications of the language!</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Python language can be used to design the back-end of our application or be used for building artificial
            intelligence. In addition, Python can also be used for data analysis.
        </p>
        <p>In other words, it is a server-side language for building the logic of an application. And so it is an
            efficient language both for building small systems and for developing complex applications.</p>
        <p>Here are some specifications of this language:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Python language is multi-paradigm, which means that we can program based on different
                    programming styles, such as functional, procedural, and object-oriented programming.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Python is a cross-platform language, as it has versions for several operating systems, including
                    Windows, Linux, and macOS. In addition, it is maintained by the Python Software Foundation (PSF), a
                    non-profit organization.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Python is an interpreted language since it does not generate executable files like C, for
                    example. Instead, it contains an interpreter, which is responsible for translating the source code into
                    machine language and thus executing the program.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In practice, the interpreter transforms the source code to byte code format, which corresponds
                    to machine language or binary code, and sends it to an environment called PVM - Python Virtual Machine -
                    being a Python virtual machine that contains the environment capable of executing the program.</p>
            </li>    
        </ul>
        <p>It is important to say that there is a way to generate executable files from source code written in Python.
            However, you need to use tools developed by third parties, such as Py2exe, and PyInstaller, among others,
            which can be downloaded for free from the Internet.</p>

            <h2>Why is Python so highly valued? 5 reasons to learn it!</h2>
        </header>
        <p>As we mentioned at the beginning of the text, the Python language ranks second in the world in preference.
            Several factors contribute to this positive result. Check out why it is worth learning to program in this
            language.</p>
        <h3>1. it is easy to learn</h3>
        <p>The Python language has a simple syntax that is as objective as possible. One example is that we do not need
            to use semicolons at the end of each statement and braces to delimit the commands of repeat and conditional
            structures, as happens in other programming languages.</p>
        <h3>2. It is portable and cross-platform</h3>
        <p>The Python language can be installed on different operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS. In
            addition, there are portable distributions that can be used on flash drives, which is ideal to make life
            easier for programmers in the application development phase.</p>
        <h3>3. It is open source and free</h3>
        <p>The Python language is open source, which means that you can download its source code written in C language
            and make changes. You also do not have to pay for a license to use it. In addition, it contains numerous
            free libraries and frameworks that you can use for additional features.</p>
        <h3>4. It offers multiple development possibilities</h3>
        <p>It is possible to develop different types of applications with Python, from commercial desktop systems to
            more complex Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence software. The libraries and frameworks available
            for the language further expand the development possibilities.</p>
        <p>One example is the Django framework, which is used to develop web applications. For all this breadth, it was
            chosen first as the most desired programming language by programmers in the 2020 Stack Overflow survey.</p>
        <h3>5. It is a "wild card" language</h3>
        <p>The Python language is extremely powerful and offers a wide possibility for system development.</p>
        <p>As a consequence, it expands the job opportunities for programmers, who can choose from different development
            possibilities such as web applications. In addition, its syntax is simple and intuitive, which makes it easy
            to learn.</p>

            <h2>Hello World</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Making your first "Hello World"!</p>
        <p>Before we talk about the practical concepts of the Python language, let's take a look at how a simple "Hello
            World" is made to start working with this language. </p>
        <p>To give a "Hello World" and have it displayed on the screen, we only need one line of code. What? Exactly
            that, just one line. To do this, you need to open your code editor, which can be pyCharm or Visual Studio
            Code, and type the following command: </p>
        <code>print("Hello World")</code>
        <p>In this case, to run a file with the .py extension, you must open the command prompt on your machine and
            navigate to where the created Python file is located.</p>

    <section  id="What_is_a_variable_in_Python?" class="main-section">
        <header>
            <h2>What is a variable in Python?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Before we talk about what is a variable in Python, it is important to remember its concept. In practice, a
            variable is an addressable space in the computer's memory (RAM) that is allocated during program execution
            to store a certain value that can be used several times in a program.</p>
        <p>The contents stored in a variable can be of different data types, such as strings, integers, Boolean, etc.
            One of the most important characteristics of variables in Python is that they indicate the reference to an
            object, that is, any variable represents an object.</p>
        <p>In other words, variables are like little boxes that hold information in the memory of our hardware. Each
            variable would be a little box with its respective value contained in it. Here is an example:</p>
        <code>
            names = ['John', 'Mary', 'Peter']<br>
            list_names = names<br>
            list_names.append('Paula')<br>
            <br>
            print(list_names)<br>
            #Result: ['John', 'Mary', 'Peter', 'Paula']<br>
            <br>
            print(names)<br>
            #Result: ['John', 'Mary', 'Peter', 'Paula']<br>
        </code>
        <p>In the code above, we create a list called "names with 3 items. Next, we say that "the variable "list_names"
            receives the values of "names". Finally, we display the contents of the two variables on the screen. Notice
            that even without updating the contents of the variable "names", it reflects the changes made to
            "list_names".</p>
        <p>This is exactly because it stores the reference of the memory space in which the list was created. So when we
            change the list to add one more element, all variables that point to this memory space will reflect this
            update.</p>
        <p>It is important to say that there are mutable data types, which accept change to their original contents, and
            immutable data types, which allocate new memory space whenever a change is made. Thus, data of immutable
            variables are sort of lost in memory until a resource called a collector, which works like a garbage
            collector, cleans up the contents.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="What_are_primitive_variables?" class="main-section">
        <header>
            <h2>What are primitive variables?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>A primitive variable in Python means a representation of some concept in our everyday life, which can be
            letters, numbers, and punctuation marks, among others. They are used to define the amount of memory that
            will be allocated. </p>
        <p>Let's look below at some examples of primitive variables:</p>
        <h3>a) Integers</h3>
        <p>The integer type represents non-decimal positive or negative numbers of unlimited size. For a variable to be
            considered of type integer, it is enough to assign a value with these characteristics to it or to indicate
            the type before assigning the value. Here is an example:</p>
        <code>
            a = 1<br>
            b:int = 1<br>
            <br>
            print(type(a)) #Result: &lt;class 'int'&gt;<br>
            print(type(b)) #Result: &lt;class 'int'&gt;
        </code>
        <h3>b) Float</h3>
        <p>The type float, which is called the floating-point number, is also part of the numeric type and is
            represented by numbers that contain one or more decimal places. Here is an example:</p>
        <code>
            i = 199.90<br>
            print(i) #Result: 199.9<br>
            print(type(i)) #Result: &lt;class 'float'&gt;
        </code>
        <h3>c) Bool</h3>
        <p>The bool type is represented by one of two possible values, these are: True or False, which indicates true or
            false. In addition to being declared in variables, bool type values are used to compare and evaluate
            expressions. Check out the example below:</p>
        <code>
            i = 10<br>
            result = (i == 10)<br>
            print(result) #Result: True<br>
            <br>
            print(i == 10) #Result: True<br>
            print(i >= 10) #Result: True<br>
            print(i &lt; 10) #Result: False
        </code>
        <h3>d) String</h3>
        <p>In Python, the string type works like an array of characters. Therefore, you can access each character
            through its corresponding index. To declare a string, simply enter the content delimited by quotation marks
            or double-quotes. Here is an example:</p>
        <code>name = 'João da Silva'<br>
            print(name) #Result: João da Silva<br>
            print(type(name)) #Result: &lt;class 'str'&gt;
        </code>

    <section  id="What_are_Built-Ins_variables?" class="main-section">
        <header>
            <h2>What are Built-Ins variables?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Built-ins are functions that are already built into the language by default, not requiring the import of
            third-party files. </p>
        <p>Let's look at some examples of these functions: </p>
        <h3>(a) abs → return the absolute value of a number, that is, it will always return a positive number:</h3>
        <code>
            abs(-3.6)<br>
            #Result: 3.6<br>
            <br>
            abs(-5.4)<br>
            #Result: 5.4<br>
            <br>
            abs(-9)<br>
            #Result: 9<br>
            <br>
            abs(87)<br>
            #Result: 87
        </code>
        <h3>b) bin → performs the conversion of an integer number into a string in binary format:</h3>
        <code>
            bin(10)<br>
            #'0b1010'
        </code>
        <h3>c) type → returns the data type of the value that was passed as parameter, in parentheses: </h3>
        <code>
            type(555)<br>
            #class 'int'<br>
            <br>
            type('hello')<br>
            #class 'str'<br>
            <br>
            type(2.8)<br>
            #class 'float<br>
            <br>
            type([34.5])<br>
            #class 'list'
        </code>

            <h2>What are the data types in Python?</h2>
        </header>
        <p>In Python, it is not necessary to initialize a variable as in other programming languages. When you assign
            any value to it, it will be identified according to the data types available in the language. </p>
        <p>In addition to the variable types that were explained earlier, we have the following types: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Long</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The long type belongs to the set of integer numeric types of unlimited size. In practice, this data type in
            Python is only used up to version 2. x of the language. As of version 3. x, all variables declared as an
            integer can have unlimited length.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>None Type</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The None type belongs to the NoneType class and is an object used to indicate null values. In practice, it is
            a keyword that indicates, for example, that a certain variable does not contain any values. It is important
            to say that None differs from an empty string, an integer equal to zero, or the boolean value False.</p>
        <p>We can assign the value None to any variable to indicate that it has no specific value. It can also be used
            to parse expressions. Take a look at the following code:</p>
        <code>
            print(type(None)) #Result: &lt;class 'NoneType'&gt;<br>
            i = None<br>
            a = i<br>
            print(i == a) #Result: True<br>
            print(i == None) #Result: True<br>
            print(a == None) #Result: True<br>
            <br>
            print(type(a)) #Result: &lt;class 'NoneType'&gt;<br>
            print(type(i)) #Result: &lt;class 'NoneType'&gt;<br>
            print(i == False) #Result: False<br>
            print(i == 0) #Result: False
        </code>

    <section id="Conditional_structures_in_Python:_if,_elif,_and_else" class="main-section">
        <header>
            <h2>Conditional structures in Python: if, elif, and else</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Every programming language needs to have conditional structures, which are commands used to check whether an
            expression is true or false and execute certain blocks of code in each specific situation. Check out how the
            if, elif, and else structures work in Python.</p>
        <h3>if/else</h3>
        <p>The Python if statement is used to check the condition of an expression and execute or not a certain block of
            code. The if statement can be executed alone or in conjunction with the else statement, which makes it
            possible to execute another set of code if the evaluated condition is false.</p>
        <p>See the syntax in the following pseudocode:</p>
        <code>
            if &lt;condition_true&gt;:<br>
            &emsp; &lt;code_block&gt;<br>
            else:<br>
            &emsp; &lt;other_code_block&gt;
        </code>
        <p>It is important to say that in Python there is no need to delimit the code block with the opening and closing
            braces: "{" and "}", as happens in other programming languages. In practice, it is enough to add the colon
            character ":" after the expression. </p>
        <p>Here is an example algorithm of code with the Python if-else structure:</p>
        <code>
            name = 'John<br>
            if name == 'John':<br>
            &emsp; print(True)<br>
            else:<br>
            &emsp; print(False)<br>
            #Result: True
        </code>
        <h3>if/elif/else</h3>
        <p>There are situations when you might need to evaluate another condition if the first statement is false. In
            this scenario, we can use the elif statement, which evaluates if another condition is true. See the syntax
            below:</p>
        <code>
            if &lt;condition_true&gt;:<br>
            &emsp; &lt;code_block&gt;<br>
            elif &lt;new_condition_true&gt;:<br>
            &emsp; &lt;new_code_block&gt;<br>
            else:<br>
            &emsp; &lt;other_code_block&gt;
        </code>
        <p>We can also use the else command to execute another code block if the condition is not satisfactory. See the
            example code below:</p>
        <code>
            number = 20<br>
            if numero &lt; 10:<br>
            &emsp; print(True)<br>
            elif number == 20:<br>
            &emsp; print("The number is equal to 20")<br>
            else:<br>
            &emsp; print(False)<br>
            #Result: The number is 20
        </code>

        <header>
            <h2>Returning a sequence of numbers: Python range function</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The Python range function is used to create a number sequence. We can determine what the start value will be,
            the breakpoint, and the value used to increment the list, which by default is 1.</p>
        <p>This is a useful feature to serve as a counter in repeat structures, for example, or to apply to variables
            when we need to use sequential numbers as lists or tuples. Take a look at the code below:</p>
        <code>
            numbers = list(range(11))<br>
            print(numbers)<br>
            #Result: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]<br>
            for i in range(0, 11, 2):<br>
            &emsp; print(i)<br>
            <br>
            '''<br>
            result:<br>
            0<br>
            2<br>
            4<br>
            6<br>
            8<br>
            10<br>
            '''
        </code>
        <p>In the above code, we use the range() function to create a list with 10 elements, and also in a for
            repetition structure to serve as a counter to print out the even numbers in the range 0 to 10.</p>

        <header>
            <h2>Python for repetition loop</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The Python for loop is used to execute a given block of commands from the evaluation of an expression made in
            iterable variables. It is worth noting that iterable elements are those that can be manipulated sequentially
            by the __next__() and __iter__() functions, such as strings, lists, or tuples. See the syntax below:</p>
        <code>
            for &lt;element&gt; in &lt;element_set&gt;:<br>
            &emsp; &lt;code_block&gt;<br>
        </code>
            See an example code:<br>
        <code>
            list_languages = ['Python', 'C', 'Java', 'JavaScript']<br>
            for language in list_languages:<br>
            &emsp; print(language)<br>

    <section  id="Python_while-repetition_loop" class="main-section">
        <header>
            <h2>Python while-repetition loop</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The Python while repetition structure is used when you need to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as
            a certain condition is true. When using this feature, however, attention must be paid to ensuring that there
            is a breakpoint that indicates the end of loop execution. Here is the syntax:</p>
        <code>
            while &lt;true_condition&gt;:<br>
            &emsp; &lt;code_block&gt;<br>
            else:<br>
            &emsp; &lt;other_code_block&gt;<br>
        </code>
            Check out some example code:
        <code>
            language = 'Python'<br>
            i = 0<br>
            while (i &lt; len(language)):<br>
            &emsp;print(language[i])<br>
            &emsp;i += 1<br>
            <br>
            '''<br>
            Result:<br>
            P<br>
            y<br>
            t<br>
            h<br>
            o<br>
            n<br>
            '''
        </code>
        <p>In the code above, we use the while loop to scroll through the contents of a string and display each
            character on the screen. Notice that we use the variable "i" as a counter, as an index to access each
            character of the string, and as a breakpoint for the while loop.</p>

        <header>
            <h2>Storing items in a single variable: Python list</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The Python list is a data structure used to store multiple values in a single variable. Its elements are
            organized sequentially and accessed through the index corresponding to the item or through methods for
            manipulating lists available in the language.</p>
        <p>You can store several types of data in a list, such as strings, integers, bools, and even other lists. The
            elements of a list are delimited by the bracket signs: "[" and "]". Here is an example:</p>
        <code>
            list_people = ['John', 23, ['Python', 'JavaScript']]<br>
            print(list_people) #Result: ['John', 23, ['Python', 'JavaScript']]<br>
            print(type(list_people)) #Result: &lt;class 'list'&gt;

    <section id="Get_to_know_some_Python_string_methods" class="main-section">
        <header>
            <h2>Get to know some Python string methods</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The Python language offers several methods to facilitate the manipulation of variables of type string. It is
            important to remember that the string is immutable, so any changes to its contents will be stored in a new
            variable. Check out some of these methods below.</p>
        <h3>a - Splitting strings into substrings and returning in lists: split</h3>
        <p>The split() method is used to split a string into one or more substrings. The result is returned in list
            form. By default, the separator is always considered the space character, however, we can define another
            character, in addition to determining how many elements we want in the list. Here is an example:</p>
        <code>
            programming_languages = 'Python JavaScript C Ruby'<br>
            list_languages = programming_languages.split()<br>
            <br>
            print(list_languages) #Result: ['Python', 'JavaScript', 'C', 'Ruby']<br>
            print(type(list_languages)) #Result: &lt;class 'list'&gt;
        </code>
        <p>Notice that in the variable "list_languages" we split the string "programming_languages" with the split()
            function and it separated the elements according to the space character found.</p>
        <h3>b - Replacing substrings inside a string: python replace</h3>
        <p>Another method available for string manipulation is Python replace(). In practice, it creates a new string
            with the change indicated in the function, which has three parameters. Here is the syntax:</p>
        <code>string.replace(old value, new value, count)</code>
        <p>The parameters old value and new value are mandatory and indicate respectively the old value and the new
            content. The count parameter is optional and indicates the number of times the change will be performed. See
            an example:</p>
        <code>
            programming_languages = 'Python JavaScript C Ruby'<br>
            languages = programming_languages.replace(' ' ', '-')<br>
            print(languages) #Result: Python-JavaScript-C-Ruby<br>
            print(type(languages)) #Result: &lt;class 'str'&gt;
        </code>
        <p>In the above code, we used the replace() function to replace the space character with the hyphen
            character.</p>

        <header>
            <h2>Learn about class methods</h2>
        </header>
        <p>A class method is a method that belongs to the class as a whole. It does not need instances for it. In this
            case, a class method has the @classmethod keyword as its declaration. Let us take a look at the following
            example: </p>
        <code>
            class Greeting(object):<br>
            &emsp; @classmethod<br>
            &emsp;def hello(cls):<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;print("Hello to %s" % cls.__name__)<br>
            Greeting.hello()<br>
            #"Hello to Greeting"
        </code>
        <p>All functions in Python have the word def, which is a reserved word for functions, just like functions in
            JavaScript.</p>

    <section id="Get_to_Know_Instance_Methods" class="main-section">
        <header>
            <h2>Get to Know Instance Methods</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Unlike class methods, instance methods need an instance to be invoked. This is a method that you will use a
            lot in your studies:</p>
        <code>
            class Product(object):<br>
            &emsp;def myProduct(self):<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;print("Hello to %s" % self.__class__.__name__)<br>
            Product.myProduct()<br>
            <br>
            #TypeError: hello() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'
        </code>
        <p>In the above case, we see that the product function was invoked. </p>
        <p>Getting to Know Static Methods</p>
        <p>Static methods are similar to class methods, but they do not require a class object as a parameter. In this
            case, a static method has the @staticmethod keyword as a declaration:</p>
        <code>
            class Greeting(object):<br>
            &emsp;@staticmethod<br>
            &emsp;def hello(cls):<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;print("hello to %s" % cls.__name__)<br>

            Greeting.hello()<br>
            # TypeError: hello() missing 1 required positional argument: 'cls'
